# Overview
Probably a bit too purpose-built but this helps simplify management of a Linux server running containers for a media server.

- Assumes docker-compose but you can alter the config.py to use other tools.
- Assumes sudo but you can alter config.py to use other tools.
- Assumes debian-base but you can alter config.py to use other distros.

# To Do
- Fix the Edit feature so it doesnt go all laggy.
- Add a feature to inspect the containers when clicking or pressing enter on one in the top container box.
